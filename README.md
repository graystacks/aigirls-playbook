**Private notes.**

If you’re reading this, you were given access directly.

This isn’t a course.  

This isn’t step-by-step hand-holding.  

It’s a practical breakdown of how people are using AI personas to monetise attention.

Read everything once.  

Then decide what you want to execute.

## What this is

This is a high-level map of how AI girl pages are built, grown, and monetised.

Not theory.  

Not motivation.  

Not “get rich quick”.

Just how the system actually works, broken down into phases.

You’ll see what matters, what doesn’t, and where people usually fuck it up.

---

## Phase 1 — Build the model

This phase is about setting up something that *can* make money later.

### Stage 1 — Create the persona

How to think about the character, not just how it looks.  

Positioning, vibe, and why most models feel fake.

### Stage 2 — Promo content

What content actually works for reach vs what’s a waste of time.  

Posting cadence, formats, and expectations.

### Stage 3 — Exclusive content

What’s gated, what’s public, and why most people gate the wrong things.

---

## Phase 2 — Distribution & growth

This is where most people stall or burn accounts.

### Stage 4 — Instagram funnel

How traffic actually moves from content → DMs → money.

### Stage 5 — Algorithm leverage

What helps distribution and what gets you shadowed or stuck.

### Stage 6 — Scaling structure

How people run multiple pages without losing control.

---

## Phase 3 — Monetisation

This is where the money comes from *if* the earlier phases weren’t rushed.

### Stage 7 — Sales flow

How monetisation is framed without killing the page.

### Stage 8 — Profile monetisation

What converts, what doesn’t, and why “links everywhere” usually fails.

### Stage 9 — Profitable structure

How people stabilise income instead of spiking and dying.

## Extras / Notes

These aren’t required, but they speed things up if used properly.

- Growth planning  
- Hands-off setups  
- Chatting frameworks  
- Making content feel real

- Platform-specific strategies (TikTok, Threads, X)

## How to use this

Don’t treat this like a checklist.

Read everything once.  

Then pick **one** direction and execute.

Most people fail because they keep switching paths, not because the system doesn’t work.
