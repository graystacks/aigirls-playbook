# Stage 1 – Create Your Model

Before you touch any AI tools, you need to actually decide **who this girl is**.

Not random AI pics.
Not “PrincessLust_9845”.
An actual character that feels real.

This part matters more than people think.

## 1. Create a Unique Persona

If you skip this, your model will look like generic AI slop with zero personality.

Guys don’t want “AI girl #749”.
They want someone that feels like a girl they *could* date.

Answer these quickly:

- **What’s her name?**  
  Keep it normal. If it looks spammy, you already lost.

- **Where’s she from?**  
  Doesn’t matter if it’s fake. Just have a story.

- **What’s her vibe?**  
  Pick ONE to start:
  - fitness girl  
  - gamer girl  
  - shy girl-next-door  
  - rich MILF  
  - anime / cosplay  
  Whatever — just commit to one.

This affects:
- captions
- chats
- outfits
- content direction  
Literally everything later.

Open your notes app and write this in under 3 minutes.

If it takes longer, you’re procrastinating.

## 2. Find a Reference Model (Very Important)

You now need **reference images** for how she should look.

Some people use real Instagram models as references.
I can’t recommend that — it’s against guidelines.

Bad reference images will ruin your model permanently.

I’ve included ready-made reference examples you can use immediately.

## Reference Image Rules (Do Not Ignore)

All reference images should be:

- High quality (1080p+)
- The **same person** (or extremely similar)
- A mix of shots (face, body, outfits, angles)
- Clear facial features  
  (No heavy filters, no insane eyelashes — it breaks training)

If you mix different faces, you will fuck the model forever.

She’ll look like a different girl in every photo.
That kills the entire account.

One face. Always.
